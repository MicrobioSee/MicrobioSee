- The web-based visualization toolkit developed in this study can be used on all operating system platforms that support modern browsers, and MicrobioSee provides data mining and visualization services for the field of microbial integration research.

- MicrobioSee is a complementary toolkit for multi-omics data, and available free of charge from https://microbiosee.gxu.edu.cn; 
- Detailed user documentation can be found at https://microbiosee.github.io, 
- The main code are available at https://github.com/MicrobioSee/MicrobioSee.

- In this work, we developed MicrobioSee, a web-based real-time interactive visualization tool based on web technologies, which could visualize microbial multi-omics data and include seventeen modules surrounding the major omics of microorganisms such as transcriptome, metagenome, and proteome. Subsequently, three case studies were chosen to represent the functional application of MicrobioSee. Overall, we provide a concise tool along with user-friendly, time-saving, cross-platform, and source-opening for researchers especially microbiologists without coding experience.
